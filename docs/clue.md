## Overview
We think the Clue is pretty neat! It's got all sorts of embedded sensors, Bluetooth, and CircuitPython capabilities. It gives you a lot of freedom to choose how you make your projects. The below guide is a really great resource for getting started with the Clue, but if you're looking for some more specific resources, we've catalogued some underneath as well.
